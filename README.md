# Traffic Simulation with SUMO and Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a traffic simulation environment using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) integrated with reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion through intelligent traffic signal control.
